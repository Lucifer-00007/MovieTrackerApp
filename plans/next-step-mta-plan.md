## Bugs

#### Priority Lv: P0
- [] Fix the following packages compatibility warning, following best practices:
	```
	> expo start

	Starting project at /Users/ani/Developer/ANI/🍀 Projects&Orgs/1VibeCodeAI/AntiGravity/MovieTrackerApp
	React Compiler enabled
	Starting Metro Bundler
	The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
	  @types/jest@30.0.0 - expected version: 29.5.14
	  jest@30.2.0 - expected version: ~29.7.0
	Your project may not work correctly until you install the expected versions of the packages.

	```
